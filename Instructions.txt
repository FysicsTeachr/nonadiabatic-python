Add comments very sparsely. Mostly only use them when calling a function from an imported file. like:

import abc
#calling asd from abc
y=asd(x)
#calling linalg from numpy
#calling inbuilt function xyz

if lines go over 60 characters, 
try to continue in next line rather than letting the line get long. This holds for comments too. 

files of different format may be provided in .txt format, for example main.py.txt

see summary.txt
